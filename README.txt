The VoteSmart Webform module provides a legislative representative lookup widget as a webform component field. This widget queries representatives via the VoteSmart API. Resultant representatives with email address can then be used as webform submission recipients.

In essence, this module extends webform to be an e-advocacy tool, allowing site administrators to create robust and "free" online petition forms without developer intervention.
